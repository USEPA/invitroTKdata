Title: In Vitro Toxicokinetic Data Processed with the 'invitroTKstats' Pipeline
Description: A collection of datasets containing a variety of in vitro toxicokinetic 
             measurements including -- but not limited to -- chemical fraction unbound 
             in the presence of plasma (f_up), intrinsic hepatic clearance (Clint,
             uL/min/million hepatocytes), and membrane permeability for
             oral absorption (Caco2). The datasets provided by the package were 
             processed and analyzed with the companion 'invitroTKstats' package.
