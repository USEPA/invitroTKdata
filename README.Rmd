## Welcome to the GitHub repository for the invitroTKdata package

The `invitroTKdata` R package contains a collection of datasets containing a variety of *in vitro* toxicokinetic measurements including -- but not limited to -- chemical fraction unbound in the presence of plasma ($f_{up}$), intrinsic hepatic clearance ($Cl_{int}$), and membrane permeability for oral absorption (Caco2). The datasets provided by the package were processed and analyzed with the companion `invitroTKstats` package

**Notification:** *Datasets within this package have all been processed with various prototype versions of the `invitroTKstats` R package. We refer users to the [`invitroTKstats` R package](https://github.com/USEPA/invitroTKstats.git) and [invitrotkstats_dataproc](https://github.com/USEPA/invitrotkstats_dataproc.git) GitHub pages to obtain the latest version of the package and original raw data/processing scripts, respectively.*

If you are interested in contributing or want to report a bug, please submit a issue or start a discussion.
